Hi there! My name is **Alex Salguero**, born in Barcelona and currently living in London.

I'm a professional **software developer** currently having fun at [Coniq](http://www.coniq.com "Coniq"). I'm interested
in all things related to clean code, software craftsmanship, software architecture and design in web applications.

I've worked extensively (and still do) in languages such as Java and PHP, but the new hype for functional programming has
picked my interest and I'm currently experimenting and playing around with Scala and its different libraries and frameworks.

That's mainly what I'm intending to be blogging about. Some of my findings, things that took me a while to figure out or
simply few brain dumps which always help to fully grasp some concepts.
